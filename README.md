# Hi, I'm Vivian! ðŸ‘‹

An innovative individual pursuing a Computer Science and Leadership & Management double major at Rutgers University. I am seeking opportunities to develop and contribute both technical and business skills to projects that drive meaningful impact.
My passion lies in Computer Science, but I also find aspects of the business-side of corporations fascinating. I am looking to go into software development/IT or management consulting.
